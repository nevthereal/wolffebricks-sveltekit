## ℹ️ About this repository

This is probably one of the final versions of Wolffe Bricks. I found the framework which I will probably use in the future: [**SvelteKit**](https://kit.svelte.dev). \
Porting this app to SvelteKit is a huge step in my development journey and I am glad I chose [Skeleton UI](https://skeleton.dev) to help me with that. \
SvelteKit will not only allow me to bring the backend and frontend closer together, because it, is compared to React, a full-stack framework. SvelteKit's efficient routing system also comes in handy.
